# NBA_Machine-Learning
====================

## Motivation

I spent few days creating  a machine learning model to make predictions of  2014-2015 NBA season. I also tried different machine learning algorithms to see which method works better with my problem. By the end of this exercise, the model had already exceeded approx  overall 70% accuracy (better than random guessing).

## Installation
1. Python 2.7
2. Numpy
3. Scikit lean
4. Matplotlib

## How it Works
